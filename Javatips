Class : Collection of methods and variables

Class Syntax : 
      access, class, class name
      
Static : (SuperPower)
     - We can call the method without creating an object
     
Void : (Eg. Vaddi Kaasu)
     - method should not have a return value.
     
Main : Its just an keyword 

Method : block of code which only runs when it is called
      Syntax : access, returntype, methodName
 
Variable :  data container that saves the data values during Java program execution
      Syntax : access, datatype

Object : 'new' keyword is used to create the object.
      Syntax : classname refname = new classname
      
Constructor : Classname and the constructor name should be same
     - method that is invoked when an object of the class is created
     - Once the object is created the hidden default constructor is created
      Syntax : classname();
      
this - refers to the current object in a method or constructor
